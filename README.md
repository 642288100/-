# Numercal_Analysis
Numerical Analysis Course Design

This project is mainly divided into two parts:

·The first part is about the numerical calculation method of the initial value problem of the ordinary differential equation

   · Contains a total of five numerical calculation methods
   
      ·Explicit Euler Method
      
      ·Trapezoidal formula method
      
      ·Improved Euler method
      
      ·Runge-Kutta method
      
      ·Adams-Bashforth method
      
   · Concludes a summary and comparison of the five methods at the end

   · Interpolation Methods

      · Lagrange Interpolation

      · Hermite Interpolation

   · Numerical Integration
   
·The second part is about the ascent of single-stage rockets

   · A four-part
   
     · Acceleration
     
     ·speed
     
     ·high
     
     ·Single-stage rocket launch problem
     
   · Each part is divided into three stages
   
     ·Engine on -- stage1
     
     ·Engine off (rising) -- stage2
     
     ・Engine off (down) -- stage3
     
   ·Multiple stages merge
   
     ·The first and second stages merge -- stage12
     
     ·Merge all stages -- stage_all or stage
     
   ·The question of why you cannot use a single-stage rocket to launch a satellite is discussed in the single-stage rocket launch issue
